18:36 <cujojp> mr_luc I tried cloning ur bots and couldnt get them
               to start
18:36 <cujojp> your irc_config must contain some magic

18:38 <hswe> bot = new Derpo require( './irc_config' )
18:39 <hswe> probably the login stuff
18:39 <hswe> like queza has that too
18:39 <cujojp> yea
18:39 <hswe> because i need to auth with a password to save the
             nick
18:39 <mr_luc> cujojp: nah no magic, jussasec
18:39 <hswe> mr_luc: do you know how to grab a names list with
             node-irc?
18:40 <mr_luc> it's just this: module.exports = {server:
               'irc.freenode.net', channel: '#coolkidsusa'}
18:40 <cujojp> bot = new irc.Client('irc.freenode.net',
               'fukmahdad', debug: true, channels: ['#coolkidsusa']
               )
18:40 <cujojp> but derpo seems to use responderbot?
18:41 <mr_luc> yeah all my bots use that ... maybe it should be a

18:44 <mr_luc> hswe: hah, I think me and fraw were talking about
               that one day at space ... I think you have to send
               the actual irc command NAMES, but then node-irc has
               a listener
18:45 <hswe> mr_luc: yeah ive tried sending direct commands to the
             server
18:45 <mr_luc> but that for it to work 'right', without spamming
               the channel with NAMES, you'd have to maintain a
               list and add/subtract as people join
18:45 <hswe> and can't seem to get anything
18:45 <mr_luc> huh!
18:45 <mr_luc> that's surprising ... like if derpo says "/me blah"
               does IRC ignore it somehow?
18:46 <hswe> like freenode accepts /NAMES #coolkidsusa
18:46 <hswe> as a valid command

19:11 <mr_luc> interesting, to use these kinds of commands cleanly
               takes a little thinking ... ie lots of things can
               trigger a /names command, and so when you want to
               trigger it yourself, you want a once-only callback,
